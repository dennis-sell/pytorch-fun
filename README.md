# Pytorch examples.
All in Pytorch v1.0.
Main development environment in Google's Colab.

Online Tutorials:
  - Pytorch website's transfer learning for bees vs ants
  - Pytorch website's adversarial examples for MNIST dataset

Other Projects:
  - Adversarial ML at Scale: An implementation of an academic paper by authors including Goodfellow which explores adversarial attacks and defenses on Neural Nets: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01236 
    - Added script from a Pytorch tutorial to generate a CIFAR model as a target model.
